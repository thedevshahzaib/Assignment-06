    <h3 id="html">HTML:</h3>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to structure web pages, providing the foundation
        for websites by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and tables. It is a markup language
        rather than a programming language, working alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. Every
        HTML document starts with a doctype declaration and includes an html tag containing the head and body sections.
        The head stores metadata, while the body contains visible content. HTML elements are written using opening and
        closing tags, with attributes that add functionality, such as the src attribute in an img tag. Heading tags (h1
        to h6) define text hierarchy, while lists (ul and ol) structure information. Hyperlinks, created with the a tag,
        allow navigation between pages. Forms enable user input through elements like text fields, checkboxes, and
        submit buttons. Tables display structured data using table, tr, and td tags. HTML5 introduced semantic elements
        such as header, nav, section, and footer to enhance readability and accessibility. Multimedia support includes
        img, audio, and video tags, improving media integration without external plugins. The anchor tag (a) creates
        hyperlinks, with attributes like target for opening links in new tabs. HTML5 also enhances web applications with
        features like new input types, canvas for graphics, and SVG for scalable images. It integrates seamlessly with
        CSS for design and JavaScript for dynamic behavior, while frameworks like Bootstrap, React, and Angular extend
        functionality. Accessibility is improved with semantic elements, alt attributes, and ARIA roles, ensuring
        compatibility with screen readers. HTML works with back-end technologies like PHP, Python, and databases for
        dynamic content. Responsive design, achieved through CSS media queries and flexible layouts, ensures
        adaptability across devices. SEO benefits from proper HTML structuring, such as using headings, meta
        descriptions, and alt text for better search rankings. As a foundational web development skill, HTML continues
        evolving with modern advancements, remaining essential in creating responsive, accessible, and interactive
        websites.

    <h3 id="css">CSS:</h3>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML
        elements on a webpage. It allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to
        HTML content, improving the visual appeal and user experience. CSS separates the content of a webpage (HTML)
        from its design, making it easier to maintain and modify. CSS rules are written using selectors, which target
        specific HTML elements, and declarations, which define the styles to be applied. Declarations consist of
        properties and values, such as "color: blue" or "font-size: 16px." CSS can be written inline within HTML tags,
        embedded in the head section of a document, or linked externally through an external stylesheet. One of the key
        features of CSS is its ability to create responsive layouts through media queries, ensuring that websites adjust
        to different screen sizes, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. CSS also supports various layout
        techniques, including Flexbox and Grid, which allow for more flexible and complex designs. Animations and
        transitions in CSS enable the creation of interactive effects, such as fading, sliding, and changing colors. CSS
        also includes tools for typography, including font families, sizes, and line heights, as well as techniques for
        creating spacing, alignment, and positioning, such as margins, padding, and floats. The "cascade" in CSS refers
        to the hierarchy of styles, where styles are applied in a specific order, with more specific rules overriding
        less specific ones. This cascading feature gives developers control over the styling, making it easy to apply
        global styles or target specific elements with precision. CSS has evolved over time, with CSS3 introducing
        advanced features like shadows, gradients, and rounded corners. It also supports custom properties (CSS
        variables), which allow developers to define reusable values for colors, sizes, and other styles. CSS plays a
        critical role in web development, enabling the creation of visually appealing, responsive, and interactive
        websites that enhance the user experience while maintaining separation of content and presentation.</p>
    <h3 id="javascript">JAVASCRIPT:</h3>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive elements on websites. It allows
        developers to add functionality to web pages, such as responding to user actions, manipulating content, and
        handling data without reloading the page. JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple form
        validation to complex animations and game development. It runs in the browser, making it an essential part of
        client-side scripting, but it can also be used on the server-side with environments like Node.js. JavaScript
        code is typically embedded in HTML documents using the script tag or linked to an external file. One of the core
        features of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the
        structure of a webpage. By accessing and modifying the DOM, JavaScript can change the content, style, and
        structure of a webpage in real time. JavaScript also supports event-driven programming, allowing it to respond
        to user actions such as clicks, mouse movements, key presses, and more. It includes built-in functions for tasks
        like mathematical calculations, string manipulation, and working with dates and times. With JavaScript,
        developers can create interactive features such as pop-up windows, image sliders, form validation, and real-time
        content updates. JavaScript works closely with HTML and CSS, enabling seamless integration between structure,
        design, and behavior. It also supports asynchronous programming through mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and
        async/await, allowing tasks to run concurrently without blocking the main thread. JavaScript is highly
        versatile, supporting object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming paradigms. It has a vast ecosystem
        of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which simplify development by providing
        pre-built components and tools. With JavaScript, developers can create responsive, interactive wb applications,
        making it a fundamental technology alongside HTML and CSS in modern web development.</p>
